# Expo CLI Error: Icon Rendering Issue with @expo/vector-icons

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the `@expo/vector-icons` package in an Expo project. The problem arises when an icon name is specified that doesn't exist within the selected icon family.  The error message itself isn't particularly helpful, making debugging challenging.

## Problem
The core issue lies in the mismatch between the requested icon name and the available icons in the chosen icon family.  This leads to a runtime error without a clear indication of the underlying problem.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully verifying the icon name against the documentation of the selected icon family (e.g., FontAwesome, MaterialCommunityIcons, Ionicons).  If an icon is not available in the chosen family, either switch to an icon family that includes the icon, or find a suitable alternative icon within the current family.
